There is an unofficial WCF channel for SQL Service Broker posted by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/806/737" target="_blank">David Browne</a> on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ssbwcf" target="_blank">www.codeplex.com/ssbwcf</a>. To quote from the project homepage: _It allows the WCF developer to leverage SSB while staying within the WCF Service Model or Channel Model programming models. The WCF SSB transport provides durable, two-way queue-based communications that requires only SQL Server 2005/2008 as its infrastructure._
