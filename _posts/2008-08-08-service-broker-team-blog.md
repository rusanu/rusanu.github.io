The team members have already made strides and covered some hot topics like [shipping near real-time OLTP data to ETL](http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_service_broker/archive/2008/07/09/real-time-data-integration-with-service-broker-and-other-sql-techniques.aspx), some [advanced discussion of SSB routing](http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_service_broker/archive/2008/07/14/using-multiple-routes-in-service-broker.aspx), [poison message handling](http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_service_broker/archive/2008/06/30/poison-message-handling.aspx), some juicy [internals how-it-works](http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_service_broker/archive/2008/06/26/service-broker-periodic-tasks.aspx) details and also revisited that never exhausted topic of [setting up your first remote dialog](http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_service_broker/archive/2008/06/10/a-simple-secure-dialog-with-certificates.aspx).
