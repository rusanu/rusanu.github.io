Few days ago I noticed that my StackOverflow profile shows [995 consecutive visited days](http://stackoverflow.com/users/105929/remus-rusanu). So naturally I started thinking about what does it mean to come back every day for a thousand days in a row. Looking back at the post I wrote almost 3 years ago to the day: [stackoverflow.com: how to execute well on a good idea](http://rusanu.com/2009/05/18/stackoverflowcom-how-to-execute-well-on-a-good-idea/) I can say that not much has changed: StackOverflow (and now the entire StackExchange network) is first and foremost a great community. The technical execution and the social nurturing of the site makes for a low friction environment that invites and rewards contribution, and it keeps getting better and better.
