I am following the 37signals blog ever since I kinda randomly stumbled upon their <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/" target="_blank">Getting Real</a> book. If you never heard about them, definitely check out the book, is a very common sense approach to managing product development in the age of Internets. On this post <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1798-jasons-talk-at-big-omaha-2009" target="_blank">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1798-jasons-talk-at-big-omaha-2009</a> I was really touched by one remark: **Inspiration is perishable**. The ideas you have can linger in your head for a long time, but the inspiration for it fades quickly. So don&#8217;t postpone it, by the time you get to it you&#8217;ll only deliver a pale image of the original idea. Do it when you&#8217;re pumped up and thrilled by it.

I reckon I&#8217;m a procrastinator deLuxe, but I have to agree. I know the difference between working at 2 am. and not feeling a bit tired when I&#8217;m excited about my work on one hand, and the damp feeling of exhaustion that drags you to watch some stupid TV show at 6 pm because I&#8217;m bored with the current project on the other hand.
