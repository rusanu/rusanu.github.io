I will attend tomorrow, December 4, the [Data Mining and Business Intelligence for Enterprises](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&eventid=1032360249&flag=1) event in Bucharest thanks to an invitation from my friend the SQL Server MVP Cristian Lefter. Now I know that most readers of this blog will not be in Romania ðŸ™‚ but I thought to post this case you happen to be there and want to have a Service Broker chat or just want to meet me and say Hi!
