As many you probably already know, the Professional Association of SQL Server (aka. PASS) will have an european conference at Neuss, Germany, between April 14 and April 16 this year. The event site <http://www.european-pass-conference.com> has details about the event, including the agenda, sessions and speakers list. I myself am one of the speakers and I will present techniques for administering, monitoring and troubleshooting Service Broker, with a focus on the new monitoring and troubleshooting tools available for Service Broker in SQL Server 2008. 

So if you attend the conference stop by to discuss things Service Brokerish or just to say Hi!
