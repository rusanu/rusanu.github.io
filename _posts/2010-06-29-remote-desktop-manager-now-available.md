It allows you to tile and monitor multiple remote desks at once, and overall is a wonderful tool for anyone using remote desktops frequently.

Fortunately now the tool is available publicly for download from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4603c621-6de7-4ccb-9f51-d53dc7e48047&#038;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft Download</a> site.
