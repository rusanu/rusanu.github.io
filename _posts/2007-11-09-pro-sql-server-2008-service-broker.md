Klaus has announced that he will release an update on his &#8216;Pro SQL Server 2005 Service Broker&#8217; book with changes covering new features, revisiting some of the 2005 features like Query Notifications with more detailed coverage and much more. Not only that, but his announcement at <http://www.csharp.at/blog/PermaLink,guid,a863c47b-2cfd-4395-bb32-e87bf33d6efe.aspx>Â actually invites you to post back comments with what would _you_ like to see in the new book.
