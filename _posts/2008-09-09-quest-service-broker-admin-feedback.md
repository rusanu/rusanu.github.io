While looking at the Google Analytics report for this very blog I found a new refferal site: <a href="http://questservicebroker.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://questservicebroker.blogspot.com/</a>. A blog with &#8220;servicebroker&#8221; in its name, I had to check it out :). Turns out that Quest is working on the next generation of tools for Service Broker administration and has opened a blog to discuss new features and request feedback. These are the same tools I&#8217;ve blogged about before <a href="/2008/05/16/viable-tools-for-service-broker/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you want to suggest features you&#8217;d like an Admin tool for Service Broker to have, now is your chance.
