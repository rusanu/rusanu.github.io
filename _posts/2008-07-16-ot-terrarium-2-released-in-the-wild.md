Those who played with the original Terrarium project back in .Net 1.1 now have a chance to revisit this fun project. The Terrarium2 for .Net 2.0 was released on [codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/terrarium2), including the project sources.  
If you never had a chance to see the Terrarium, check it out. Terrarium allows you to create creatures with behavior you program in .Net and set them up into a virtual peer-to-peer world of Terrarium instances. You can track your creature in the wild, how does it do against other creatures. A nice incentive to learn some basic AI stuff and keep your programming skills sharp in a fun virtual fight-to-the-death competition with other programmers.
