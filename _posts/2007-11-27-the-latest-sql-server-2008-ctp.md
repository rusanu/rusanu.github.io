I&#8217;ve been away for the last couple of weeks and I had no time to update this blog when the latest SQL Server 2008 CTP release has been made available (download at h[ttp://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/prodinfo/download.mspx](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/2008/prodinfo/download.mspx)), so the news that this CTP was released is probably no longer news for most of you.

Why this release is so important for Service Broker fans is that the diagnostics tool is contained in it: ssbdiagnose.exe. The best part is that this tool works with and can diagnose SQL Server 2005 deployments as well as SQL Server 2008, so you can actually use it to troubleshoot your existing projects and sites. The usage of this tool is straightforward once you get past the complex command line syntax, and I will cover this soon with a more lengthy tutorial post dedicated to it.
