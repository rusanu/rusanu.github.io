Some of you already know this: I am again FTE with Microsoft. I was in a contract for a very interesting project with Microsoft IT over the past months in a vendor position, and getting back in touch with the cool stuff that goes on inside Microsoft kindled back the passion for bold projects with big impact. Since April 29 I&#8217;m working again as a developer with what is officially known as the SQL RDBMS Core Team. I&#8217;m no longer involved with the Service Broker though, I now work on the Access Methods. Indexes, BTrees, Heaps and lets not forget DBCC. Fun stuff.
