## RUSANU CONSULTING

We offer consulting and technical expertise for web and database application development and database administration, deployment and troubleshooting. Our experience covers C++ development for server products, C# development of database applications and web services and anything concerning Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server, and specially SQL Server 2005.

### Remus Rusanu

I am an independent consultant offering SQL Server development and administration services. I&#8217;ve been working professionally with databases since 1994. For more than 6 years I&#8217;ve been a developer with Microsoft, member of the SQL Server team in Redmond, WA.

I have hands-on real-life experience in troubleshooting some of the most difficult problems database deployments encounters. My troubleshooting approach is a methodological one rooted in experience and a deep understanding of how SQL Server works. I&#8217;ve investigated and diagnosed poorly planned hardware, badly designed applications, improperly configured servers. I have improved application response times by two and even three orders of magnitude in situations considered desperate.

I am an experienced database application architect and developer. With a deep understanding of almost every SQL Server feature and technology, I know how to deploy it and use it correctly. After all, I&#8217;ve been working with SQL Server 2005 since 2001 and some of the features you are using today were designed, coded or tested by myself.

I am an active member of the SQL Server community. I am one of the moderators and amongst the main contributors to some of the SQL Server forums on MSDN. I am the author of a very popular blog that covers SQL Server topics with a focus on Service Broker.

Besides my SQL Server expertise I am also an accomplished C++ developer having worked in some of the most demanding, non-trivial, development environments. I am also an experienced C# developer, with a very solid understanding of all application and web design topics.
