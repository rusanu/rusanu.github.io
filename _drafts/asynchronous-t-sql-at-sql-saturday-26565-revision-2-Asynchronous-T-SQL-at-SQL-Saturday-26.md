The Seattle area PASS group is organizing the <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/eventhome.aspx?eventid=30" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #26 in Redmond on October 2nd</a>. There are many sessions to fill 3 tracks for a full day and all of them look quite interesting. The full schedule is available at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/schedule.aspx?eventid=30" target="_blank">http://www.sqlsaturday.com/schedule.aspx</a>. The event is free and you get to hear presentations by such popular SQL persona as <a href="http://www.sqlserverinternals.com/" target="_blank">Kalen Delaney</a>!

On the 10:15 slot yours truly will be talking about [Asynchronous T-SQL processing](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sessionid=735). See you this Saturday at the new Commons MS campus in Redmond.
