Recently I wanted to go over again Rick Vicik papers on high performance programs on the Windows platform. These papers are a true Bible for anyone in need to write truly highly scalable and high performance server applications. They address the back end C/C++ programming and explain how to properly use the Windows threading, optimize I/O and specially the importance of data cache conscious programming, NUMA object allocations and access locality and impact of data sharing on performance. I do find however that many of the principles explained there apply just as well to C# and .Net programming. I wanted to refresh my memory on some issues so I searched for them and to my delight I found that Rick updated the papers for Vista and Windows 2008 and had posted them as a three part series on the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/winserverperformance" target="_blank">Windows Performance blog</a> and I wanted to share these with my blog audience:
