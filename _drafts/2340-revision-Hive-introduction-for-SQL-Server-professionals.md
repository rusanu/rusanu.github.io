Over the past year I&#8217;ve been involved with the Hive project and I got to know better not only Hive and Hadoop, but also the Apache and OSF community. In the SQL Server community I know that Hive is generally unknown so I thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss how Hive works, and specially compare with how SQL Server works. My experience with both SQL Server and Hive is that of a contributor. This is a different point of view from how an end user (developer or admin) would probably compare the two.
