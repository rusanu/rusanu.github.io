The problem around incorrectly measured IO times due to CPU time drift was fixed by the [SQL Server 2005 SP3](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ae7387c3-348c-4faa-8ae5-949fdfbe59c4&displaylang=en) release. I have talked about this issue and explained the problem in my post: [http://rusanu.com/2008/10/28/event-id-833-io-requests-taking-longer-than-15-seconds](http://rusanu.com/2008/10/28/event-id-833-io-requests-taking-longer-than-15-seconds/).
