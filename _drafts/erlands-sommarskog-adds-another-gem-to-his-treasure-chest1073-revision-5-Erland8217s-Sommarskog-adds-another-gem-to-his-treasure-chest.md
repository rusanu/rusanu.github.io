There are probably no articles that I reference more often than Erland&#8217;s. Some questions on forums, discussion groups and [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) come back over and over, again and again. For some of these topics Elands has prepared articles that are, ultimately, **the** article to point anybody for more details on the topic. His coverage is deep, the articles are well structured, and they pretty much exhaust the topic.

I&#8217;m writing this blog entry not so much as to announce his latest addition <a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/query-plan-mysteries.html" target="_blank">Slow in the Application, Fast in SSMS?

:   This article describes <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc966425.aspx#XSLTsection133121120120" target="_blank">parameter-sniffing</a>, the process of &#8216;tuning&#8217; a query plan to a specific value of the input parameters, and how this process can sometime &#8216;pollute&#8217; the query plan cache with a plan that is optimized for a specific set of parameters, but performs poorly on other parameter values. The article describes what is parameter sniffing, how to identify when ti happens, and how to fx it and prevent it.
