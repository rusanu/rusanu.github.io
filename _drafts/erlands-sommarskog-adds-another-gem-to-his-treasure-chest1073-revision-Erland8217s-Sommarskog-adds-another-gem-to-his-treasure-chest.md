There are probably no articles that I reference more often than Erland&#8217;s. Some questions come back over and over, again and again, ad-nauseam, on forums , newsgroups or on [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com). For some of these topics Elands has prepared an article that is, ultimately, **the** article to point anybody for more details on the topic. His coverage is deep, the articles are well structured, and they pretty much exhaust the topic. If somebody still have questions about that topic after reading the article, then I say that person know too much or &#8230; too little. I&#8217;m writing this blog entry not so much as to announce his latest addition <a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/query-plan-mysteries.html" target="_blank">Slow in the Application, Fast in SSMS? Understanding Performance Mysteries</a> but more to create for myself a memo pad from where to pick up the link
