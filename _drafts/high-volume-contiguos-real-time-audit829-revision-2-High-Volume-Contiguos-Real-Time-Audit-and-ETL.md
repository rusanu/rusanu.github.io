Tomorrow at SQL Saturday #43 in Redmond I&#8217;ll be presenting a session documenting the real-time audit and ETL the Microsoft uses to manage the access policies on its network. This presentation goes over some of the challenges posed by a contiguos, non-stop, high trhoughput stream of audit records poses when loading the audit into a data warehouse. I&#8217;m posting here the slides I&#8217;m going to present, if you plan to attent you can preview them right now, and come to the session with an educated set of questions for your specific case.
